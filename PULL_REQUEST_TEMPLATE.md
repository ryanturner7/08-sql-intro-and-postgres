**Today, Ryan and Devin paired together. It took about 4 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on deleting the unneeded JSON from our index, along with the javascript behind it.

  3. Next we passed the constring through the client constructor
  4. And finally, we completed all of the comments we needed to do.
